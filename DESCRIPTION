Title: Production cost model evaluation and guidance tools for hydropower plants
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Sean Turner <sean.turner@pnnl.gov>
Maintainer: Sean Turner <sean.turner@pnnl.gov>
Description: hydrofixr provides tools for post-processing the hydropower dispatch of production cost models (PCMs) and generating PCM hydropower constraints. 
    hydrofixr relies on water availability simulations from the MOSART-WM model and is currently written to work with GridView, WECC-scale PCM.
    A modular design allows for alternative hydrological and PCMs to be integrated.
